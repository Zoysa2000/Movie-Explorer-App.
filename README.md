   ‚ú® Fetching Trending Movies throught TMDB API and show the details

   ‚ú®The movie search feature 
    
  uses a search bar integrated with Redux for global state management. When movie details are fetched, they are stored in the Redux store using a detailStore reducer. As the user types 
  in the search bar, results are dynamically filtered from the stored data, ensuring faster response times and reduced redundant API calls.

  ‚ú®The loading feature uses React‚Äôs useEffect and useState to simulate data fetching delays, creating a more realistic experience. A animated is displayed while movies load, enhancing UX 
   with smooth transitions before the actual content appears on screen.

  ‚ú®The movie rating feature uses a React-based star rating system to visually represent the movie‚Äôs average vote. Ratings are calculated by converting TMDb's 10-point scale into a 5-star format. Each star is 
    conditionally colored based on the score, enhancing user experience with clear, intuitive feedback for each movie's popularity.

  ‚ú®Movie trailers are displayed using the YouTube Data API by embedding videos based on trailer keys fetched from TMDb. Axios handles API calls to retrieve relevant trailer links. Users can watch high-quality 
    trailers directly within the app, offering an immersive preview without navigating away from the movie detail page.
